Data Analyst Portfolio Management Using Adventure Works Database


#Project Aim

To build a data analyst portfolio from scratch and how to set up an environment for completing the project and this project inspired from Analyze with Ali youtube channel.

# Business Request

We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from a static report to a visual dashboard.  Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients, and how it has been over time.

Seeing as each salesperson works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also.

we measure our numbers against the budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance.

The budget is for 2021 and we usually look two years back in time when we analyze sales.
